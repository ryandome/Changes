    The fundamental difference between the data discussed in chapter 7 and chapter 8 is that Cairo is concerned with the distribution of the data in chapter 7 while he is concerned with how data changes in chapter 8. The data in chapter 8 doesn't have to be normally distributed and to interpret changes in the data you don't need use measures of central tendency or the standard deviation.

    One visualization technique discussed is creating a horizon chart. Theses kinds of charts can be very useful for seeing general trends and patterns in the data but by making these changes you lose out on precision.

    Making a chart to look at time series data can be insightful but a con is that you must explore multiple levels of aggregation in order to avoid mix effects and paradoxes. Failing to do this can lead to charts that appear to have contradictory data.

    A change ratio can be useful if you want to see the rate of change of each time period in comparison to the previous one. The downside of using this is that is becomes hard to visualize the overall change rate.
